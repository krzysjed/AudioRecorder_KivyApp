## Google Drive API

This **REST API** allows us to integrate our app with Google Drive cloud storage. Thanks to it every user will be able to  
upload audio file to his **My Drive** or maybe even **Shared Drive**.  API uses OAuth 2.0 authorization protocol which   
authenticates user before every request.
