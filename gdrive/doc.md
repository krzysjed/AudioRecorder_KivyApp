## _Google Drive API_

This **REST API** allows us to integrate our app with Google Drive cloud storage. Thanks to it every user will be able to  
upload audio file to his **My Drive** or maybe even **Shared Drive**.  API uses OAuth 2.0 authorization protocol which   
authenticates user before every request.  

----

To get access to the API, every app must be registered on **Google APIs** site. Then Google provides developer with  
**credentials.json**, which contains client ID and a client secret.  Thanks to this, application will have access to   
user data in cloud storage.
